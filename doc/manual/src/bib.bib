  abstract =	 {As networks grow in scale and heterogeneity,
                  hierarchical organization is inevitable. In this
                  paper we present the case for optimal
                  selforganization of network hierarchies. We provide
                  a graph partitioning formulation relevant to
                  networking but different from extant graph
                  partitioning literature. In particular, we require
                  that the resultant partitions be connected, a
                  constraint that changes the character of the problem
                  significantly. We devise a solution that consists of
                  distinct phases for initial partitioning, refinement
                  and post-processing, propose efficient heuristics
                  for each phase, and evaluate them extensively on
                  internetwork-like graphs through simulation. Our
                  results suggest that vertex trading techniques, in
                  vogue for a number of decades in graph partitioning,
                  are highly applicable, but multilevel techniques
                  favored by conventional graph partitioning research
                  may be of limited value for internetwork-like
                  graphs. Our solution can be implemented in practical
                  networks to automatically generate Internet OSPF
                  areas or ATM PNNI clusters.},

                  important issue in dynamic networks such as packet
                  radio and ad-hoc wireless networks. Most
                  conventional protocols exhibit their least desirable
                  behavior for highly dynamic interconnection
                  topologies. We propose a new methodology for routing
                  and topology information maintenance in dynamic
                  networks. The basic idea behind the protocol is to
                  divide the graph into a number of overlapping
                  clusters. A change in the network topology
                  corresponds to a change in cluster membership. We
                  present algorithms for creation of clusters, as well
                  as algorithms to maintain them in the presence of
                  various network events. Compared to existing and
                  conventional routing protocols, the proposed
                  cluster-based approach incurs lower overhead during
                  topology updates and also has quicker
                  reconvergence. The effectiveness of this approach
                  also lies in the fact that existing routing
                  protocols can be directly applied to the network ---
                  replacing the nodes by clusters.},

  abstract =	 {In wireless ad hoc networks and sensor networks,
                  energy use is in many cases the most important
                  constraint since it corresponds directly to
                  operational lifetime. This paper presents two
                  topology control protocols that extend the lifetime
                  of dense ad hoc networks while preserving
                  connectivity, the ability for nodes to reach each
                  other. Our protocols conserve energy by identifying
                  redundant nodes and turning their radios
                  off. Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) identifies
                  redundant nodes by their physical location and a
                  conservative estimate of radio range. Cluster-based
                  Energy Conservation (CEC) directly observes radio
                  connectivity to determine redundancy and so can be
                  more aggressive at identifying duplication and more
                  robust to radio fading. We evaluate these protocols
                  through analysis, extensive simulations, and
                  experimental results in two wireless testbeds,

                  to be homogeneous, where each mobile node shares the
                  same radio capacity. However, a homogeneous ad hoc
                  network suffers from poor scalability. Recent
                  research has demonstrated its performance bottleneck
                  both theoretically and through simulation
                  experiments. Building a physically hierarchical ad
                  hoc network is a very promising way to achieve
                  scalability. Routing is critical to operate such a
                  hierarchical structure efficiently. Previous
                  research has been solely focusing on extending
                  popular routing schemes developed for the
                  homogeneous ad hoc network. In this paper, we
                  propose a new heterogeneous routing protocol
                  specifically designed for the hierarchical ad hoc
                  network. We also present a new active clustering
                  scheme to help build a stable hierarchical
                  structure, which is fundamental to heterogeneous
                  routing protocols. Simulation results using GloMoSim
                  show that our routing and clustering scheme gives
                  good performance. The results also provide some

  abstract =	 {In ad hoc, multihop wireless networks the routing
                  protocol is key to efficient operation. The design
                  of an ad hoc routing protocol is extremely
                  challenging because of mobility, limited power,
                  unpredictable radio channel behavior and constrained
                  bandwidth. As the network grows large, two
                  additional challenges must be faced: increasing node
                  density, and large number of nodes. High density
                  (i.e., a large number of neighbors within radio
                  range) leads to  superfluous  forwarding of
                  broadcast control messages. Large network size leads
                  to large routing tables and high control traffic
                  O/H. The two aspects are related and they both
                  undermine the scalability of routing protocols. In
                  this paper, we address scalability for a specific
                  class of routing protocols, namely, proactive link
                  state routing protocols. Link state protocols are
                  desirable in many applications because of low access
                  delay, ability to include QoS criteria in path
                  selection, support of alternate routes, etc. Yet,
                  these protocols are most affected by density and
                  large scale. In the paper, we propose two techniques
                  to overcome density and large scale, namely Passive
                  Clustering and Landmark Routing. We compare via
                  simulation our proposed solutions to other existing
                  scalable schemes.},

                  are independently controlled and are dynamically

                  architecture has three main advantages. First, it
                  provides spatial reuse of the bandwidth due to node
                  clustering. Secondly, bandwidth can be shared or
                  reserved in a controlled fashion in each
                  cluster. Finally, the cluster algorithm is robust in

                  both in urban environments and in inhospitable

                  unique challenges in the design of unattended

                  to hypothesize that sensor network coordination

                  global objective) may be necessary for sensor
                  network coordination. In this paper, we describe

                  for both civil and military applications. In this
                  paper, we look at communication protocols, which can
                  have significant impact on the overall energy
                  dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings
                  that the conventional protocols of direct
                  transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop
                  routing, and static clustering may not be optimal
                  for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low Energy
                  Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based
                  protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local
                  cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly
                  distribute the energy load among the sensors in the
                  network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable
                  scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and
                  incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol
                  to reduce the amount of information that must be
                  transmitted to the base station. Simulations show
                  that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8
                  reduction in energy dissipation compared with
                  conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH
                  is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly
                  throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system
                  lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

                  and wireless technologies have enabled exciting new
                  applications for wireless devices. These
                  applications span a wide range, including real-time
                  and streaming video and audio delivery, remote
                  monitoring using networked microsensors, personal
                  medical monitoring, and home networking of everyday
                  appliances. While these applications require high
                  performance from the network, they suffer from
                  resource constraints that do not appear in more
                  traditional wired computing environments. In
                  particular, wireless spectrum is scarce, often
                  limiting the bandwidth available to applications and
                  making the channel error-prone, and the nodes are
                  battery-operated, often limiting available energy.

                  My thesis is that this harsh environment with severe
                  resource constraints requires an
                  application-specific protocol architecture, rather
                  than the traditional layered approach, to obtain the
                  best possible performance. This dissertation
                  supports this claim using detailed case studies on
                  microsensor networks and wireless video
                  delivery. The first study develops LEACH (Low-Energy
                  Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), an architecture for
                  remote microsensor networks that combines the ideas
                  of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media
                  access together with application-specific data
                  aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of
                  system lifetime, latency, and application-perceived
                  quality. This approach improves system lifetime by
                  an order of magnitude compared to general-purpose
                  approaches when the node energy is limited. The
                  second study develops an unequal error protection
                  scheme for MPEG-4 compressed video delivery that
                  adapts the level of protection applied to portions
                  of a packet to the degree of importance of the
                  corresponding bits. This approach obtains better
                  application-perceived performance than current
                  approaches for the same amount of transmission
                  bandwidth. These two systems show that
                  application-specific protocol architectures achieve
                  the energy and latency efficiency and error
                  robustness needed for wireless networks.},

                  accurate localization and tracking of a target in a
                  randomly placed wireless sensor network composed of
                  inexpensive components of limited accuracy. The
                  crucial enabler for this is a reasonably accurate
                  local coordinate system aligned with the global
                  coordinates. We present an algorithm for creating
                  such a coordinate system without the use of global
                  control, globally accessible beacon signals, or
                  accurate estimates of inter-sensor distances. The
                  coordinate system is robust and automatically adapts
                  to the failure or addition of sensors. Extensive
                  theoretical analysis and simulation results are
                  presented. Two key theoretical results are: there is
                  a critical minimum average neighborhood size of 15
                  for good accuracy and there is a fundamental limit
                  on the resolution of any coordinate system
                  determined strictly from local communication. Our
                  simulation results show that we can achieve position
                  accuracy to within 20\% of the radio range even when
                  there is variation of up to 10\% in the signal
                  strength of the radios. The algorithm improves with
                  ner quantizations of inter-sensor distance
                  estimates: with 6 levels of quantization position
                  errors better than 10\% are achieved. Finally we show
                  how the algorithm gracefully generalizes to target
                  tracking tasks.},

                  resolve many issues. In a mobile ad hoc network
                  (MANET) in particular, due to host mobility, such
                  operations are expected to be executed more
                  frequently (such as finding a route to a particular
                  host, paging a particular host, and sending an alarm
                  signal). Because radio signals are likely to overlap
                  with others in a geographical area, a
                  straightforward broadcasting by flooding is usually
                  very costly and will result in serious redundancy,
                  contention, and collision, to which we refer as the
                  broadcast storm problem. In this paper, we identify
                  this problem by showing how serious it is through
                  analyses and simulations. We propose several schemes
                  to reduce redundant rebroadcasts and differentiate
                  timing of rebroadcasts to alleviate this
                  problem. Simulation results are presented, which
                  show different levels of improvement over the basic
                  flooding approach.},

                  key scheduling algorithm of RC4, and describe their
                  cryptanalytic significance. We identify a large
                  number of weak keys, in which knowledge of a small
                  number of key bits suffices to determine many state
                  and output bits with non-negligible probability. We
                  use these weak keys to construct new distinguishers
                  for RC4, and to mount related key attacks with
                  practical complexities. Finally, we show that RC4 is
                  completely insecure in a common mode of operation
                  which is used in the widely deployed Wired
                  Equivalent Privacy protocol (WEP, which is part of
                  the 802.11 standard), in which a fixed secret key is
                  concatenated with known IV modifiers in order to
                  encrypt different messages. Our new passive
                  ciphertext-only attack on this mode can recover an
                  arbitrarily long key in a negligible amount of time

                  introduced in 1990 by Even, Goldreich and
                  Micali.  They presented a general method for
                  converting any signature scheme into an
                  on-line/off-line signature scheme, but their method
                  is not very practical as it increases the length of
                  each signature by a quadratic factor.  In this paper
                  we use the recently introduced notion of a trapdoor
                  hash function to develop a new paradigm called
                  hash-sign-switch, which can convert any signature
                  scheme into a highly efficient on-line/off-line
                  signature scheme: In its recommended implementation,
                  the on-line complexity is equivalent to about
                  $0.1$  modular multiplications, and the size of
                  each signature increases only by a factor of two. In
                  addition, the new paradigm enhances the security of
                  the original signature scheme since it is only used
                  to sign random strings chosen off-line by the
                  signer. This makes the converted scheme secure
                  against adaptive chosen message attacks even if the
                  original scheme is secure only against generic
                  chosen message attacks or against random message

                  communication over a public network. It provides
                  anonymous connections that are strongly resistant to
                  both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Onion
                  routing's anonymous connections are bidirectional
                  and near real-time, and can be used anywhere a
                  socket connection can be used. (In some contexts not
                  even socket connections are needed to use onion
                  routing.) Any identifying information must be in the
                  data stream carried over an anonymous connection. An
                  onion is a data structure that is treated as the
                  destination address by onion routers; thus, it is
                  used to establish an anonymous connection. Onions
                  themselves appear differently to each onion router
                  as well as to network observers. The same goes for
                  data carried over the connections they
                  establish. Proxy aware applications, such as web
                  browsing and email, require no modification to use
                  onion routing, and do so through a series of
                  proxies. A prototype of onion routing is running in
                  our lab. This paper describes anonymous connections
                  and their implementation using onion routing. This
                  paper also describes several application proxies for
                  onion routing, as well as configurations of onion
                  routing networks. },

  networks feasible and useful, and has not concentrated on security.
  
  We present a suite of security building blocks optimized for
  resource-constrained environments and wireless communication. \infacr has two
  secure building blocks: SNEP and mTESLA. SNEP provides the following
  important baseline security primitives: Data confidentiality, two-party data
  authentication, and data freshness. A particularly hard problem is to provide
  efficient broadcast authentication, which is an important mechanism for sensor
  networks. mTESLA is a new protocol which provides authenticated broadcast for
  severely resource-constrained environments.  We implemented the above
  protocols, and show that they are practical even on minimal hardware: the
  performance of the protocol suite easily matches the data rate of our network.
  Additionally, we demonstrate that the suite can be used for building higher
  level protocols.},

                  around them. Every network node runs the watchdog
                  and pathrater. The watchdog mechanism in a node
                  detects if a neighbor misbehaves: (assuming that any
                  neighboring node can hear all of its neighbor's
                  communication) the watchdog checks that the next hop
                  correctly forwards the packet to the following
                  hop. The pathrater keeps state on how well other
                  nodes in the network behave.}

                  Seminal paper on security definitions for encryption.
                  Work motivated by the observation that the
                  construction based on trapdoor functions lack
                  following two deficencies:
                  - trapdoor one-wayness doesn't exclude that f(x)
                    might be invertible if x is of special form.
                  - it can also not be ruled it (and in fact in most
                    cases is not the case!) that partial information
                    on the input is leaked.
                  They define a public key cryptosystem (PKC) as a
                  turing machine (TM) $\Pi$ that on input $k$ the security
                  parameter and a TM $MG$ the message generator
                  (sampler) provides descriptions of a TM E
                  (encryption) and D (decryption) such what $D(E(m)) =
                  m | \forall m \in MG(k)$. All TMs are probabilistic and
                  polynomial time (in input). Note it is essential for
                  encryption that the TM is probabilistic to meet the
                  security definitions! 

                  They provide two definitions for secure PKC (taking
                  only passive attackers into account!):
                  - polynomial security:
                    $ |P(A(E(m_1),aux)=1) - P(A(E(m_2),aux)=1)| < 1/p(k) ::
                       \forall polynomials p(k);
                       \forall MG(k); 
                       {E,D} <- \Pi(k,MG);
                       \forall A,F \in P/poly(k);
                       {m_1, m_2, aux} <- F(E,MG)$
                  - semantic security:
                    $ |P(A(E(m), 1^n)=f(m)) - P(A'(1^n)=f(m))| < 1/p(k) ::
                       \forall polynomials p(k);
                       \forall MG(k); 
                       \forall f; 
                       \forall A \in P/poly(k);
                       \exists A'  \in P/poly(k);
                       {E,D} <- \Pi(k,MG);
                       m <- MG(k)$
                     Note that for the uniform version one normally
                     adds an input (arbitrary computable) h(m) to A
                     and A' to model apriori knowledge. For
                     non-uniform however adding h() doesn't add
                     strength. see \cite{Goldre93}. 
                     Also note that f does not have to be computable,
                     not even recursive.
                  It can be shown, partially here, partially later
                  (\cite{Goldre93}) that these notions are equivalent
                  under non-uniform and uniform complexity definitions.

                  They provide and proof secure under above definition
                  following PKC: encrypt bit-by-bit bit $b_i$ with a
                  unapproximable trapdoor predicate (UTP) $B$ (ala
                  hardcore predicate) by selecting a random element
                  fulfilling $x_i$ so that $B(x_i) = b_i$. An example
                  system secure under the quadratic residuosity
                  assumption is as follows:          
                  $SK$ (trapdoor): prime $p_1,p_2$ of size $k$
                  $PK$: $n=p_1p_2$, $y$ a QNR with jacobisymbol 1.
                  $E$: foreach bit $b_i$ { $x_i \random \Z{n}^*; e_i := x_i^2 y^b_i$}
                  $D$: foreach encryption bit $e_i$ { $b_i := Q_n(e_i)$ }

                  wireless network of mobile devices. The main difficulty are
                  power- and computation-constrained devices (Peanut-CPU). This
                  prevents usage of most asymmetric techniques. They address the
                  following issues:
                  - Availability. They present a battery power exhaustion
                    attack ("sleep deprivation torture attack"). Most mobile
                    devices are usually in sleep mode, so waking them up and
                    making them compute requires precious battery power.
                  - Authenticity. They state that a new problem in this
                    environment is the absence of an online server. The goal is
                    secure transient association, meaning that new devices can be
                    integrated securely in an environment. They propose the
                    "resurrecting duckling" security policy, which uses a
                    mechanism similar to the imprinting of birds after they hatch
                    the egg: the new-hatched bird recognizes the first moving
                    object it sees which makes a special sound as its
                    mother. So if we get a new device, we use physical contact to
                    perform key exchange (imprinting). (They also have process
                    called reverse metempsychosis to describe what happens after
                    death of the device).
                  - Integrity. Since signatures are too expensive, use shared
                    keys and MAC to achieve data integrity (and authenticity). 
                    They also discuss tamper resistance in this context.}

                  exchange secure against dictionary attack: simple
                  password encrypted key exchange (SPEKE). 
                 
                  SPEKE is more or less DH-EKE \cite{BelMer92,STW95a} 
                  except that the password is not used to encrypt the
                  residues but to generate the base as a generator of
                  the (prime) order $q$ multiplicative subgroup
                  of a prime order $p$ group used for the
                  DH-exponentiations. Two examples are proposed:
                  $g=S^{p-1/q}$ or $g={g'}^S$ with $S$ the password and
                  $g'$ a generator of the subgroup. 
                  The second case is actually broken (allows
                  dictionary attack after one active attack: B sends
                  ${g'}^x$ and on receiving A's reply $g^y, ...$ can
                  test with ${(g^y)}^{x/S}$).
                  For the first case one has to make sure that $g$ is
                  not 1 which is unlikely (1/q) for sufficiently large
                  order subgroups.
                  we might operate for efficiency reasons in a small
                  subgroup (note that $g$ can be precomputed/cached on the
                  server side! But also care has to be taken that no
                  other really small subgroups exist or the
                  performance advantage is gone (e.g you have to check
                  the order of received elements!)) though taking
                  \cite{OorWie96} into account we might also use small
                  exponents with safe primes (though getting semantic
                  security seems somewhat harder to achieve as we
                  would have specialized instances of the DH decision
                  problem) 
                 
                  the author makes then a threats/countermeasure
                  analysis on the choices of the mathematical
                  structures (groups, generator) to use in SPKE and
                  DH-EKE \cite{BelMer92,STW95a}. As it covers a number
                  of issues not coverd in the two previously cited papers
                  it's a 'must-read' for implementers of EKE protocols.

                  since the data is only transported if the others
                  really want it. They also use a simplistic strategy

                  requests an object if it has enough power to receive

                       catch all but 1 in 4 billion errors. 
                       Analysis of 100,000 packets which fail the TCP checksum shows the
                       Internet has a wide variety of error sources which are not detected by
                       link-level checksums. Analysis tools have identified nearly 100 different
                       patterns, or likely cause, of the observed errors. These categories explain
                       half our observe errors, and show that errors occur at all levels of the
                       network. 
                       From the observed rate of incorrect checksums, and excluding errors that will
                       always be caught, we conclude that the TCP checksum will fail to detect an
                       error for rougly 1 in 200 milllion packets. From our analysis of the cause of
                       erros, we propose simple changes to several protocols which can decrease
                       the rate of undetected error.},

                  not share any other prior electronic context. How
                  can they set up a secure session among their
                  computers? We examine various alternatives and

having received much attention in the last several years. The
fundamental challenge revolves around secure and efficient group key
management. While centralized methods are often appropriate for key
distribution in large groups, many collaborative group settings
require distributed key agreement techniques. This work investigates a
novel approach to group key agreement by blending binary key trees
with Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The resultant protocol suite is
secure, very simple, and fault-tolerant. Moreover, its efficiency
surpasses prior art.},

                  multicast security based on distributed computation
                  of security transforms by intermediate nodes. The
                  involvement of intermediate nodes in the security
                  process causes a new type of dependency between
                  group membership and the topology of the multicast
                  network. Thanks to this dependency, the containment
                  of security exposures in large multicast groups is
                  assured. The framework also assures both the
                  scalability for large dynamic groups and the
                  security of individual members. Two different key
                  distribution protocols complying with the framework
                  are introduced. The first protocol is an extension
                  of the E1 Gamal encryption scheme whereas the second
                  is based on a multi-exponent version of RSA.},

                  reliable multicast transport protocols do not scale well to
                  large groups, they propose that the key server uses
                  forward error correction (FEC) to encode the key
                  update message. As long as the member receives a
                  sufficient fraction of the key update packets, it
                  can reconstruct the information. The fallback
                  mechanism in case too many packets were lost, is that
                  the member uses a unicast connection to the key
                  server to recover the missing keys. Since the
                  authors assume independent packet loss, this scheme
                  is quite effective, although in practice, the loss
                  characteristic is correlated.}
