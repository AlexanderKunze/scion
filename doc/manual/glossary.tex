%    \gitem{Title}{Description}

% Creates an entry of the form Title --> Description.
% This list of items is automatically sorted by title.
% When inserting an entry, don't care about its position.

% When you introduce an abbreviated entry, e.g., Core Beacon
% Server (CBS), then please add below your \gitem entry an
% abbreviation entry as follows:

%    \abbrev{CBS}{Core Beacon Server}

% This entry will appear in the abbreviation list (behind
% the glossary) and in the index with both abbrevation and
% non-abbreviated string.


%%% How to create manual index entries? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If you want to add a manual entry to the index, please
% use the additional optional argument as follows:

%    \gitem[Keyword]{Title}{Description}

% The keyword string will appear in the index and point
% to the page where the glossary entry appears.
% Be careful when using the optional index keyword in
% conjunction with the \abbrev command. Both add an index
% entry. You should omit the index keyword from \gitem
% in case you use \abbrev.

% The \abbrev command also allows for the specification of
% individual index entries.

%    \abbrev[core beacon server]{CBS}{Core Beacon Server}

% In this case, the index will contain the entries
%  "core beacon server"  and  "CBS"
% instead of the usual two entries
%  "Core Beacon Server"  and  "CBS".
% Please use this optional argument to achieve consistency
% in the index.

\gitem[path server]{Path Server}{Facility within an isolation domain
where end hosts register their up- and down-paths. End hosts can
query path servers in order to obtain valid paths do a destination.}

\gitem{Isolation Domain (ISD)}{Hierarchical and self-contained unit
with own jurisdiction in which a number of ASes are located.}

\abbrev{ISD}{Isolation Domain}

\gitem[half-path]{Half-Path}{Up-path from an end entity to the ISD
core, or down-path from the ISD core to an end entity.}

\gitem[inter-domain path]{Inter-Domain Path}{Path between two ADs
that are located in two different ISD cores.}

\gitem[end-to-end path]{End-to-End Path}{Stitched path between two
end entities, typically consisting of three paths: an up-path, an
inter-domain path, and a down-path.}

% Pawel.

\gitem{Core Beacon Server (CBS)}{Facility within a core AD that
initiates the PCB construction.}

\abbrev{CBS}{Core Beacon Server}

\gitem{Local Beacon Server (LBS)}{Facility within a non-core AD that
receives all Path Construction Beacons (PCBs) from the provider ADs.
At every propagation period, an LBS performs two steps: (a) it
selects $k$ PCBs and registers them as down-paths at the Core Path
Server (CPS), and (b) it selects $k$ PCBs and registers them as
up-paths at the Local Path Server (LPS). Selection criteria for down-
and up-paths may differ.}

\abbrev{LBS}{Local Beacon Server}

\gitem{Path Construction Beacon (PCB)}{to be done!}

\abbrev{PCB}{Path Construction Beacon}

\gitem{Core Path Server (CPS)}{Facility within a core AD, where
non-core ADs (within a given ISD) register their down-paths. The CPS also
serves down-path requests by translating a requested (ISD, AD) pair to
an appropriate down-path.}

\abbrev{CPS}{Core Path Server}

\gitem{Local Path Server (LPS)}{Facility within a non-core AD, where
Local Beacon Servers register their up-paths. End hosts can query an
LPS in order to obtain valid up- and down-paths to a destination.
Down-paths are obtained through querying the Core Path Server (CPS)
or using cached results.}

\abbrev{LPS}{Local Path Server}

% Cristina.

\gitem[static path]{Static Path}{Long-lived, low-bandwidth
reservation on top of half-paths. Static paths are initiated by leaf
ADs and are used in SIBRA for two purposes: (1) as a building block
for priority paths: to guarantee availability during connection
setup, and to perform weighted bandwidth reservation, and (2) to
provide communication guarantees for low-bandwidth traffic, e.g.
control traffic.}

\gitem[priority path]{Priority Path}{Short-lived, high-bandwidth
reservation on top of end-to-end paths, i.e., up-path, inter-domain
path, and down-path. Priority paths are initiated by end hosts in
SIBRA. They are only valid on the order of tens of seconds, and thus
needs to be continuously renewed.}

\gitem{Reservation Token (RT)}{Cryptographically authenticated token
that enables the usage of SIBRA bandwidth reservations. RTs are
enriched opaque fields that encode the amount of bandwidth and the
validity of an AD's bandwidth reservation for a specific flow.}

\abbrev{RT}{Reservation Token}

\gitem[DRKey protocol]{DRKey Protocol}{Protocol to enable routers
$R_i$ on a source-specified path $\langle S, R_1, \allowbreak R_2,
\ldots, D\rangle$ to set up on-the-fly shared keys with source $S$
and destination $D$. DRKey protocols enable routers to re-derive keys
on the fly when needed, thus avoiding the need of per-flow state on
routers.}


\gitem[DRKey session]{DRKey Session}{Session that identifies the
packets sent by a source $S$ to a destination $D$ on the same path,
during a certain period of time. A DRKey session is typically
associated with a flow that travels the same network path, such as a
TCP flow in SCION.}

\gitem[Retroactive-DRKey]{Retroactive-DRKey}{DRKey protocol that
enables entities on the path to set up shared keys at any time after
the first packet in a DRKey session reaches the destination.
Retroactive-DRKey hides the source's intention to set up shared keys
with the routers on the path, preventing coward attacks.}


% Sam and David

\gitem{Local Path Server (LPS)}{Service that retrieves a path from
itself to a SCION address. The LPRS receives (from a local client) as
input a destination SCION address, and returns up to $k$ up-paths and
up to $k$ down-paths between the AD where the LPS resides and the
destination's AD. Note that the LPS cannot independently resolve the
full path across ISDs, so queries to paths outside of the current ISD
are forwarded to Core Path Servers. LPSes can cache down-paths
received from a core path server to reduce path resolution latency.
ADs may choose to replicate LPS functionality across multiple devices
increase availability.}

\abbrev{LPS}{Local Path Server}

\gitem{Core Path Server (CPS)}{Server that stores intra-ISD down-paths and
resolves inter-ISD paths. CPSes are located in the ISD's core ADs. Each
Beacon Server within the same ISD registers up to k down-paths with the
CPS. The CPS receives from a LPS as input a destination SCION address
and returns up to $k$ down-paths to the destination AD. If the
destination AD resides within a different ISD, the CPS requests the
down-paths from the remote (destination) ISD's core path server before
returning these paths to the LPS. To reduce path resolution latency, a
CPS can cache down-paths received from a CPS in a different ISD. A CPS
can be replicated within an AD to increase availability. Additionally,
all core path servers within a single ISD run a consistency protocol to
ensure a consistent view of ISD-local paths.}

\abbrev{CPS}{Core Path Server}

\gitem[address]{SCION Address}{Network-level address of a device
using SCION. A SCION address takes the form
\texttt{ISD:AD:client\_addr}. ISD is a unique identifier among ISDs.
AD is a unique identifier within an ISD. client\_addr is some
network-level identifier within an AD. client\_addr must be unique
within an AD, but may be, e.g., an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or
other local network address.}

\gitem[Isolation Domain]{Isolation Domain (ISD)}{Logical grouping of
networks under a common organizational domain. Networks within an ISD
should also share a common jurisdiction. Each ISD designates a set of
core autonomous domains (ADs) that provide service to subscriber ADs.}

\abbrev{ISD}{Isolation Domain}

\gitem[ISD core]{ISD Core}{Set of ADs responsible for handling
inter-ISD routing, quality of service within an ISD, and
accountability management (e.g., disabling connectivity for
misbehaving ADs).}

\gitem{Beacon Server (BS)}{Service that enables path exploration
within an ISD. The ISD core beacon server starts Path Construction
Beacon (PCB) propagation to construct a (half) path from the ISD Core
to endpoint ADs. Upon receiving a PCB, a BS appends can choose to
register the learned path with the core path server and its local
path server. The BS then propagates the PCB to its down-stream and
peering ADs and appends for each of these ADs a corresponding routing
decision (known as an opaque field). A BS in an endpoint AD only
registers paths with the LPS and CPS, since PCBs are never propagated
up-stream.}

\abbrev{BS}{Beacon Server}


% Lorenzo

\gitem{Opaque Field (OF)}{Opaque fields are often used in the SCION
packet header. They serve different purposes, such as: routing,
authenticity verification, and parsing of the SCION packet itself.}

\abbrev[opaque field]{OF}{Opaque Field}

\gitem{Hop Opaque Field}{Opaque field used to identify the packet
sender, i.e. by storing the sender interfaces.}

\gitem{Info Opaque Field}{Opaque field used to store further
information about the path and the packet itself, such as: Isolation
Domain ID and number of hops in the path.}

\gitem{ROT field}{Opaque field used to store information about the
Root Of Trust file used (i.e. ROT version).}

\gitem{Support Signature Field}{Opaque field used to parse the packet
and verify the packet’s signature.}

\gitem{Support Peer Field}{Opaque field used to store information
about a peer link’s bandwidth (i.e. bandwidth allocated, class).}

\gitem{Support PCB Field}{Opaque field used to store information
about a parent-child link’s bandwidth (i.e. bandwidth allocated,
bandwidth reserved).}
