% Glossary and Abbreviation List.

% Syntax:

%    \gitem{Title}{Description}

% Creates an entry of the form Title --> Description.
% This list of items is automatically sorted by title.
% When inserting an entry, don't care about its position.

% When you introduce an abbreviated entry, e.g., Core Beacon
% Server (CBS), then please add below your \gitem entry an
% abbreviation entry as follows:

%    \abbrev{CBS}{Core Beacon Server}

% This entry will appear in the abbreviation list (behind
% the glossary) and in the index with both abbrevation and
% non-abbreviated string.

% If you want to add a manual entry to the index, please
% use the additional optional argument as follows:

%    \gitem[Keyword]{Title}{Description}

% The keyword string will appear in the index and point
% to the page where the glossary entry appears.
% Be careful when using the optional index keyword in
% conjunction with the \abbrev command. Both add an index
% entry. You should omit the index keyword in case you
% use \abbrev.

\gitem[path server]{Path Server}{Facility within an isolation domain
where end hosts register their up- and down-paths. End hosts can
query path servers in order to obtain valid paths do a destination.}

\gitem{Isolation Domain (ISD)}{Hierarchical and self-contained unit
with own jurisdiction in which a number of ASes are located.}

\abbrev{ISD}{Isolation Domain}

\gitem[half-path]{Half-Path}{Up-path from an end entity to the ISD
core, or down-path from the ISD core to an end entity.}

\gitem[inter-domain path]{Inter-Domain Path}{Path between two ADs
that are located in two different ISD cores.}

\gitem[end-to-end path]{End-to-End Path}{Stitched path between two
end entities, typically consisting of three paths: an up-path, an
inter-domain path, and a down-path.}

% Pawel.

\gitem{Core Beacon Server (CBS)}{Facility within a core AD that
initiates the PCB construction.}

\abbrev{CBS}{Core Beacon Server}

\gitem{Local Beacon Server (LBS)}{Facility within a non-core AD that
receives all Path Construction Beacons (PCBs) from the provider ADs.
At every propagation period, an LBS performs two steps: (a) it
selects $k$ PCBs and registers them as down-paths at the Core Path
Server (CPS), and (b) it selects $k$ PCBs and registers them as
up-paths at the Local Path Server (LPS). Selection criteria for down-
and up-paths may differ.}

\abbrev{LBS}{Local Beacon Server}

\gitem{Path Construction Beacon (PCB)}{to be done}

\abbrev{PCB}{Path Construction Beacon}

\gitem{Core Path Server (CPS)}{Facility within a core AD, where
non-core ADs (within a given ISD) register their down-paths. The CPS also
serves down-path requests by translating a requested (ISD, AD) pair to
an appropriate down-path.}

\abbrev{CPS}{Core Path Server}

\gitem{Local Path Server (LPS)}{Facility within a non-core AD, where
Local Beacon Servers register their up-paths. End hosts can query an
LPS in order to obtain valid up- and down-paths to a destination.
Down-paths are obtained through querying the Core Path Server (CPS)
or using cached results.}

\abbrev{LPS}{Local Path Server}

\gitem[static path]{Static Path}{Long-lived, low-bandwidth
reservation on top of half-paths. Static paths are initiated by leaf
ADs and are used in SIBRA for two purposes: (1) as a building block
for priority paths: to guarantee availability during connection
setup, and to perform weighted bandwidth reservation, and (2) to
provide communication guarantees for low-bandwidth traffic, e.g.
control traffic.}

\gitem[priority path]{Priority Path}{Short-lived, high-bandwidth
reservation on top of end-to-end paths, i.e., up-path, inter-domain
path, and down-path. Priority paths are initiated by end hosts in
SIBRA. They are only valid on the order of tens of seconds, and thus
needs to be continuously renewed.}

\gitem{Reservation Token (RT)}{Cryptographically authenticated token
that enables the usage of SIBRA bandwidth reservations. RTs are
enriched opaque fields that encode the amount of bandwidth and the
validity of an AD's bandwidth reservation for a specific flow.}

\abbrev{RT}{Reservation Token}

\gitem[DRKey protocol]{DRKey Protocol}{Protocol to enable routers
$R_i$ on a source-specified path $\langle S, R_1, \allowbreak R_2,
\ldots, D\rangle$ to set up on-the-fly shared keys with source $S$
and destination $D$. DRKey protocols enable routers to re-derive keys
on the fly when needed, thus avoiding the need of per-flow state on
routers.}


\gitem[DRKey session]{DRKey Session}{Session that identifies the
packets sent by a source $S$ to a destination $D$ on the same path,
during a certain period of time. A DRKey session is typically
associated with a flow that travels the same network path, such as a
TCP flow in SCION.}

\gitem[Retroactive-DRKey]{Retroactive-DRKey}{DRKey protocol that
enables entities on the path to set up shared keys at any time after
the first packet in a DRKey session reaches the destination.
Retroactive-DRKey hides the source's intention to set up shared keys
with the routers on the path, preventing coward attacks.}
