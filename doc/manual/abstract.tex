This document describes the essential components of the V1.0 SCION
prototype including functional specifications of the SCION network
elements (e.g., servers, routers, gateways), data structures of
configuration files, and communication protocols among these
elements. In particular, this document focuses on the specification
of a working prototype and additional features that are not described
in the academic papers~\cite{ZHHCPA2011}.

This is a working document which will be continuously updated during
the prototype creation process. It includes discussions or comments
on current design issues.
